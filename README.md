# micro:bit badge

This is a super secret, open source project to design a PCB badge for [Make Zurich 2017](https://makezurich.ch).

## How to use
This is an extension board to the [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk). It's intended to be a 'bolt-and-go' extension board, saving the need for the awkward edge connector normally used to extend the micro:bit. The board must be connected on the top side of the micro:bit, because the small back pads are NOT connected.

To use, simply place on the top side of the micro:bit, and bolt it real tight.
Then, use the micro:bit as usual.

### Features
  * Breaks out all 20 pins into a standard 2.54mm 2x10 pin header area.
  * Routes all pins to an identical edge connector at the bottom to allow stacking more boards or plug to the edge connector.
  * Connections for optionals:
    * [CR2450 battery holder](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/100Pcs-Horizontal-Through-Hole-CR2450-Coin-Button-Cell-Lithium-Battery-Case-Holder-Box-Base-Socket/32772425916.html) on the back side.
    * Buzzer on the front side.
